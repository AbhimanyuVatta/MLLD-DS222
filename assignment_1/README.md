PROBLEM - 
Given DBPedia training dataset, it is required to train a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier for classification of DBPedia 
development and testing datasets with in-memory and streaming based Map Reduce approach.

The two folders Local and Hadoop contain files to run the program on local machine and a hadoop cluster using Map-Reduce respectively.


Note: It is assumed that the following are the paths of the DBPedia Datasets on turing.cds.iisc.ac.in cluster

HDFS: /user/ds222/assignment-1/DBPedia.full/
Local: /scratch/ds222-2017/assignment-1/DBPedia.full
